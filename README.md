# IPL-Dashboard
This dashboard is built using springboot and ReactJS to showcase the details of IPL matches held between 2008 to 2020. I did this project as part of learning Springboot and ReactJS through a youtube tutorial from [koushikkothagal](https://github.com/koushikkothagal)'s Javabrains channel.
